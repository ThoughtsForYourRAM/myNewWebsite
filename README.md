# My New Website

This is a simple template webpage created with the intent to teach people HTML, CSS, and how to use Google Fonts. While the API is still referenced, it is currently not utilized as the page is now self-hosting the fonts (this is recommended if you intend to have users from the European Union, see https://youtu.be/JVsJgys0VCs for more details).

## Getting Started

To view the webpage, simply follow these steps:

1. Download the files from the repository.
2. Open the HTML page in your preferred web browser.

## Development

For the best developer experience, we recommend using Visual Studio Code. Simply open the folder containing the HTML file in Visual Studio Code.
